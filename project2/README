This software system implements three different machine learning algorithms to attempt to geolocate tweets from Twitter. The system uses the Scikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/) machine learning package for Python. The KNearestNeighbors, DecisionTreeClassifier, and GaussianNB packages were used to implement these machine learning algorithms.

Pseudocode:

1. Create output files for statistics and predictions
2. Parse the input (ARFF format) and divide it into models and answers for training data, development data, and test data
3. Create 1-Nearest-Neighbors classifier and train it using the training model and training answers
4. Calculate predictions for development data using the classifier
5. Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for the predicted answers vs real answers for the development data and output these statistics
6. Calculate predicted answers for test data and output these predictions
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for 3-Nearest-Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree classifiers

To run the program:

$ python3 project2.py <training data>.arff <development data>.arff <test data>.arff

NOTE: input files must be in ARFF format
NOTE: Python3 must be used for the program to run correctly
